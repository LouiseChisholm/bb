# Louise Chisholm
I  support and advocate for researchers who use computational and data sciences or digital technologies. I work to inspire and empower researchers to leverage the opportunities created by recent technological advances and the ever-increasing amounts of data available.

I am focusing on developing the UK SKA Regional Centre (UKSRC) which will enable astronomers to explore the early universe. The UKSRC is, within an international network, developing interoperable digital research infrastructure that will enable astronomers to access, analyse and visualise SKA telescope data. In this role, **I lead the project office, community and industry engagement. **

I am passionate about enabling reserchers and organisations to achive their ***goals*** to address **impact XXX** the world. In 2016, I co-founded and led the cross-disciplinary research community, the "UCL eResearch Domain", which spanned all of UCL's faculties. I supported and advocated for the community by shaping the development of institutional digital resarch infrastructure, create initiatives to enable , to XXX    
Prior to this, I managed large EU FP7 consortia, and supported development of academic consultancy collaborations.

Within the digital research infrastructure ecosystem, I work across boundaries and cultures such as:
* research disciplines
* specialist roles (e.g. RSE, Research Infrastructure Developers, research-enabling professionals)
* sectors beyond academia (e.g. industry, SMEs)

 I make new research possible: 
 * developing strategy and funding proposals 
 * delivering governance and day-to-day operations (project management)
 * forming and supporting communities and partnerships
 * facilitating knoweldge exchange and providing **skill development** opportunities 
 
Together, this open doors to research... new possibilities for research. 
maximises the social and economic impact of digital research infrastructure investments
