# Louise Chisholm
I support and advocate for researchers who use computational and data sciences or digital technologies. I work to enspire and empower researchers to leverage the opportunities created by recent technological advances and the ever-increasing amounts of data available.

Within the digital research infrastructure ecosystem, I work across boundaries and cultures such as:
* research disciplines
* specialist roles (e.g. RSE, Research Infrastructure Developers, research-enabling professionals)
* sectors beyond academia (e.g. industry, SMEs)

 I contribute through: 
 * developing strategy and funding proposals 
 * delivering governance and day-to-day operations
 * creating new communities and partnerships
 * facilitating knowledge exchange and *xxx*
 
Together, open doors to research... new possibilities for research. 
maximises the social and economic impact of digital research infrastructure investments 



I am focusing on developing the UK SKA Regional Centre (UKSRC) which will enable astronomers to explore the early universe. The UKSRC is, within an international network, developing interoperable digital research infrastructure that will enable astronomers to access, analyse and visualise SKA data. The UKSRC is developing initiatives for UK astronomer's to enhance their skills and to preparate for the deployment of the SKA telescopes.

For 7 years, I founded and led the cross-disciplinary research community, the "UCL eResearch Domain", that spanned all of UCL's faculties.
