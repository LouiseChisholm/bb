# Louise Chisholm
I support and advocate for researchers who use  computational and data sciences or digital technologies. For 7 years, I supported the cross-disciplinary research community, the "UCL eResearch Domain", that included all of UCL's faculties. Now, I am  focusing on the UK SKA astronomy community. 

Within the digital research infrastructure ecosystem, I work across boundaries and cultures. 
* Interdisciplinary research communities
* Specialist roles (e.g. RSE, Research Infrastructure Developers)
* Sectors beyond of academia  (e.g. industry)

 
“The breadth of their skills and experiences enables PRISMs to navigate and utilise the various cultures to build communities within the research ecosystems they manage and lead in tandem with their academic counterparts. They effectively bring together the day-to-day operations, project work, and strategic growth activities.”
