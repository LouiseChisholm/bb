# Louise Chisholm
I support and advocate for researchers who use computational and data sciences or digital technologies. I work to enspire and empower researchers to leverage the opportunities created by recent technological advances and the ever-increasing amounts of data available.

I am focusing on developing the UK SKA Regional Centre (UKSRC) which will enable astronomers to explore the early universe. The UKSRC is, within an international network, developing interoperable digital research infrastructure that will enable astronomers to access, analyse and visualise SKA data. The UKSRC is developing opportunities for UK astronomer's to enhance their skills and to evaulate our evolving tools and services in preparation for the deployment of the SKA telescopes.

For 7 years, I supported and advocated for the cross-disciplinary research community, the "UCL eResearch Domain", that spanned all of UCL's faculties.   

Within the digital research infrastructure ecosystem, I work across boundaries and cultures such as:
* research disciplines
* specialist roles (e.g. RSE, Research Infrastructure Developers)
* sectors beyond academia (e.g. industry)

 I contribute through: 
 * developing strategy and funding proposals
 * leading day-to-day operations and program management
 * capacity building, community engagement and knowledge exchange
