# Louise Chisholm
I  support and advocate for people who use computational and data sciences or digital technologies in research. I work to inspire and empower researchers to leverage the opportunities created by recent technological advances and the ever-increasing amounts of data available.  

I am focusing on developing the UK SKA Regional Centre (UKSRC) which will enable astronomers to explore the early universe. The UKSRC is, within an international network, developing interoperable digital research infrastructure that will enable astronomers to access, analyse and visualise SKA telescope data. In this role, **I lead the project office, community and industry engagement. **  

This role requires a combination of strategic thinking, operational excellence, and strong leadership to drive high quality execution and continuous transformation.


I am passionate about enabling people and organisations to achieve their priorities and to **impact XXX** the world. 

In 2016, I co-founded and led the cross-disciplinary research community, the "UCL eResearch Domain", which spanned all of UCL's faculties. In this role, I led the development of the UCL Research Data Strategy amd governance

I conceived of and delivered initiatives to increase the capacity of member of UCL to undertake digital research, including a small grant scheme which promoted skill development and good practice (e.g. code clubs, hackathons), the 1st UCL Festival of Code, lunch 'n' learn sessions, community of practice for staff who facilitate data and compute, and events to support RSE career pathways. 

, operations and leadership to contribute to the development of institutional digital resarch infrastructure, supporting research funding submissions to   
Combined these activities xXX and strenghened UCL's position to apply for funding and to deliver digital Research and digital research infrastrcuture.  
Prior to this, I managed large EU FP7 consortia, and supported development of academic consultancy collaborations.

Within the digital research infrastructure ecosystem, I work across boundaries and cultures such as:
* research disciplines
* specialist roles (e.g. RSE, Research Infrastructure Developers, research-enabling professionals)
* sectors beyond academia (e.g. industry, SMEs)

 I make new research possible: 
 * developing strategy and funding proposals 
 * delivering governance and day-to-day operations (project management)
 * forming and supporting communities and partnerships
 * facilitating knoweldge exchange and providing **skill development** opportunities 
 
Together, this open doors to research... new possibilities for research. 
maximises the social and economic impact of digital research infrastructure investments 



As part of the leadership team, which established the UCL-wide Domain, I supported and 
advocated for those who use data and computational approaches in research. Working closely 
with researchers, professional service teams and senior management, I led strategic initiatives 
across three synergistic workstreams:

## Shaping the development of UCL's eResearch Infrastructure 
* I coordinated and participated in the committee which provided advice and guidance on 
UCL’s digital research infrastructure investments as part of its governance cycle. I devised 
and led initiatives to identify ideas from the research community for future investments.
* I led the development of the UCL Research Data Strategy (2019) which aims to create an 
environment to enable researchers using data to flourish.
## Strengthening UCL’s capacity & capability to harness available infrastructure 
* I established an internal funding scheme, which supported community-led initiatives that 
provided tailored activities to improve researchers’ data and software skills e.g., UCL code 
clubs, hackathons, data collaboratives, R showcase, workshops, UCL Festival of Code.
* I raised awareness of career opportunities and of how research technology professionals
contribute to the success of research with the Science & Engineering South Consortium.
## Improving the quality of research funding applications
* I initiated new collaborations and I provided advice and guidance to researchers at all 
stages of their funding applications to EPSRC, STFC, NERC, MRC and BBSRC. 
* I developed & organised interdisciplinary symposia to strengthen research themes and to 
spark collaborations across faculties e.g. AI, computational sciences


I help researchers to identify potential funding sources for their research and to develop strong applications with the best possible chance of success. I coordinate and develop large-scale strategic bids. I write non-techincal propsoal sections and prepare research teams for interviews with grant review panels. Selected projects I contributed to include: 
- STFC UK SKA Regional Centre (
- Strategic Priorities Fund [UCL Adaptable Cluster](https://excalibur.ac.uk/projects/the-ucl-adaptable-cluster-project/), which contirbutes to the Exascale Computing ALgorithms & Infrastructures Benefiting UK Research (ExCALIBUR) research programme.
- EPSRC XXX and XXX (exascale)
- EPSRC [Materials and Molecular Modelling (MMM) Hub](https://mmmhub.ac.uk/) Tier 2 national supercomputing centre, which supports the UK-wide MMM community.
- EPSRC Research Software Engineer Fellowship: [Dr Tom Dowrick](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/V052438/1) who is improving research translation in image guided surgery.
