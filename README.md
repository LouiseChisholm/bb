# Louise Chisholm
I support and advocate for researchers who use  computational and data sciences or digital technologies. For 7 years, I supported the cross-disciplinary research community, the "UCL eResearch Domain", that spanned all of UCL's faculties. Now, I am  focusing on supporting the UK SKA astronomy community. 

Within the digital research infrastructure ecosystem, I work across boundaries and cultures such as:
* research disciplines
* specialist roles (e.g. RSE, Research Infrastructure Developers)
* sectors beyond academia (e.g. industry)

 I contribute through: 
 * developing strategy and funding proposals
 * leading day-to-day operations and program management
 * capacity buliding, community engagement and impact
